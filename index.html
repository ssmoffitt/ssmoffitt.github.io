        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Madison, WI is a city I've been lucky to call home for the last 3 years. Prior to enrolling at UW-Madison my sister attended the university for 4 years, so I've spent a fair share of time in and around downtown Madison. I come from a family of go-getters and foodies so we've always pushed to explore the full extent of Madison. From my time here I've accumulated quite the list of activites for a weekend trip, summer visit, or even a lifelong stay. I created this website to share that knowledge and hopefully inspire others to love Madison as much as I do.

          <h2> About Madison</h2>
          <p>Geographically speaking Madison sits in south-central Wisconsin. It is around an hour west of Miluakee and two and half hours north of Chicago. The city sits on an isthmus with Lake Mendota to its north and Lake Monona to its south. The isthmus provides a unique experience for Madison residents, during the hot summer days it provides residents with an escape from the heat. Residents and tourists alike take to the many public piers around the lakes, some launch boats, some enjoy kayaking, but everyone loves to take a dip to cool off. In the wintertime the lakes serve yet another purpose: ice. Frozen lakes mean frozen fesitivites like ice fishing, ice skating, pond hockey, or enjoying Memorial Unions winter parties. Madison may be viewed as a college town, but it is really fueled by its near 300,000 residents which love to support the local community. On any given Saturday night downtown is packed with familes and adults enjoying the amazing dining and enterainment offered around town.   </p>
